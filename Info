I have used NLTK for the language processing part and trained my classifiers on the movie_reviews corpus that comes with NLTK in python.
I have made a class of 5 classifiers for better accuracy with each classifier being trained separately, the classifiers used here are Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree and SVC.
Tweepy is used to fetch the live tweets, for obvious reasons I have changd my access tokens and consumer keys.
